MLonCode community effort to implement Learning Distributed Representations of Code (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.09473.pdf)

Note: The authors of the paper have released their own tensorflow implementation on [GitHub](https://github.com/tech-srl/code2vec).
[Token vectors](https://s3.amazonaws.com/code2vec/model/token_vecs.tar.gz) and [Method name vectors](https://s3.amazonaws.com/code2vec/model/target_vecs.tar.gz) for their paper are available as well.
